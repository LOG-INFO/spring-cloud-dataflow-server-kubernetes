Spring Cloud Data Flow for Kubernetes is a toolkit for building data integration and real-time data processing pipelines that are deployed to Kubernetes.

<br>

Pipelines consist of [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) apps, built using the [Spring Cloud Stream](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/) or [Spring Cloud Task](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-task/) microservice frameworks. This makes Spring Cloud Data Flow suitable for a range of data processing use cases, from import/export to event streaming and predictive analytics.

<span id="overview"></span>

Spring Cloud Data Flow for Kubernetes deploys data pipelines to Kubernetes.

You can get started with common use cases by selecting from a collection pre-built [stream](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/) and [task/batch](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-task-app-starters/) starter apps for various data integration and processing scenarios facilitate learning and experimentation.

[Custom](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#custom-applications) stream and task applications, targeting different middleware or data services, can be built using the familiar Spring Boot style programming model.

The [dashboard](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#dashboard-introduction) offers a graphical editor for building new pipelines interactively, as well as views of deployable apps and running apps with metrics.  The dashboard also serves as a administrative managagement console for Tasks.

The Spring Could Data Flow server exposes a [REST API](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#api-guide-overview) for composing and deploying data pipelines. A separate [shell](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started-deploying-spring-cloud-dataflow) makes it easy to work with the API from an interactive command line.

A [stream DSL](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#_stream_dsl) makes it easy to specify which apps to deploy and how to connect outputs and inputs. A new [composed task DSL](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#_composed_task_dsl) was added in v1.2. A [Java DSL](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#spring-cloud-dataflow-stream-java-dsl) was added in v1.3

## Getting Started

The getting started section of the [latest GA release](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-kubernetes/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#kubernetes-getting-started) or the [latest Snapshot release](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow-server-kubernetes/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#kubernetes-getting-started) is the best place to follow detailed step by step instructions.
